# 📅 Event Scheduler & Resource Allocation System

A web-based application built using **Flask** that allows users to manage events, resources, and allocate resources efficiently within event timelines.  
This project is designed to avoid resource conflicts and ensure proper scheduling with a clean dashboard interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Event Management
- Create events with title, start date & time, and end date & time
- Edit and delete events
- View all events in a structured list

### ✅ Resource Management
- Add and manage resources (e.g., Conference Hall, Projector, Sound System)
- Resources can be reused across multiple events (if time permits)

### ✅ Resource Allocation
- Allocate resources to events **within the event time duration**
- Prevents overlapping allocation of the same resource
- Displays allocated resources clearly with:
  - Event name
  - Resource name
  - Date
  - Time
  - Day

### ✅ Dashboard
- Overview of:
  - Total events
  - Total resources
  - Total allocations
- Clean sidebar navigation for easy access

📊 How Resource Allocation Works
Resources are allocated only within the event duration

If a resource is already allocated for the same time, it cannot be reused

Ensures efficient planning and avoids conflicts
